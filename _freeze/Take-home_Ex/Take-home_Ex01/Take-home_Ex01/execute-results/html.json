Thanks to smartphones and technology, we now have a bunch of data about how people move. When we use smart analysis tools like GIS, we can unlock valuable insights that help us plan cities better.\n\nIn 2020, GRAB shared a set of data called Grab Posisi, all about how people move around in Singapore. This kind of information isn't just interesting; it's super helpful for businesses, people who make decisions about the city, and those who plan how cities work. It's like having a dynamic picture of how people move, helping us create cities that work well for everyone.\n\n## 1.2 Objectives\n\nThe objectives of this take-home exercise are to:\n\n-   Apply geospatial analytics to address societal challenges\n\n-   Use spatial point patterns analysis methods to explore Grab hailing services distribution in Singapore\n\n-   Organise geospatial data into sf tibble data.frames using `sf` and `tidyverse` functions\n\n-   Focus on Grab taxi location points, road layer within Singapore, and Singapore coastal boundary layer\n\n-   Generate traditional Kernel Density Estimation layers\n\n-   Create Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE)\n\n-   Utilise `tmap` functions to display kernel density layers on OSM\n\n-   Describe spatial patterns revealed by the kernel density maps\n\nBy this exercise, I will:\n\n-   Enhance my understanding of geospatial analytics applications\n\n-   Develop proficiency in spatial point patterns analysis\n\n-   Gain hands-on experience in dealing with geospatial data\n\n-   Explore Grab hailing services distribution patterns in Singapore\n\n-   Generate and interpret Kernel Density Estimation layers\n\n-   Understand the nuances of Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE)\n\n-   Learn about the visualisation of spatial patterns using `tmap` functions on OSM\n\n## 2 Getting Started\n\n## 2.1 Data Acquisition\n\nThe study will utilise the following datasets to explore spatial point patterns analysis methods and reveal the geographical and spatio-temporal distribution of Grab hailing services locations in Singapore.\n\n| Dataset Name                               | Type                | Source                                                              | Path                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Grab-Posisi                                | Aspatial (.parquet) | <https://engineering.grab.com/grab-posisi>                          | data/aspatial/grabPosisi                 |\n| Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) | Geospatial (.shp)   | <https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/2104/view>                    | data/geospatial/MPSZ-2019                |\n| Open Street Map Road Data                  | Geospatial (.shp)   | <https://download.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei.html> | data/geospatial/OSM/gis_osm_roads_free_1 |\n\n## **2.2 Importing Relevant R Packages**\n\nThe R packages used in this project are:\n\n1.  `arrow`: for reading and writing Parquet files\n\n2.  `dplyr`: for data manipulation\n\n3.  `lubridate`: for working with date-time data\n\n4.  `maptools`: set of tools for reading and manipulating spatial data formats, such as shapefiles\n\n5.  `raster`: reads, writes, manipulates, analyses, and models gridded spatial data\n\n6.  `rgdal`: from CRAN, enables users to import, export, and manipulate spatial data within the R environment\n\n7.  `RcolorBrewer`: package providing color schemes for maps and other visualizations\n\n8.  `rmapshaper`: a package for simplifying and modifying geographic shapes in R\n\n9.  `sf`: for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data\n\n10. `spNetwork`: to perform spatial analysis for NKDE\n\n11. `spatstat`: for performing spatial point patterns analysis\n\n12. `tidyverse`: a family of other R packages for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling, and visualizing data\n\n13. `tmap`: creating static and interactive maps\n\n14. `ggplot2`: used for data visualization\n\n15. `plotly`: interactive graphing library for R\n\nPacman assists us by helping us load R packages that we require.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n pacman::p_load(arrow, dplyr, lubridate, maptools, raster, rgdal, RColorBrewer, rmapshaper, sf, sp, spNetwork, spatstat, tidyverse, tmap, ggplot2, plotly)\n\n#update.packages(ask = FALSE, dependencies = TRUE)\n## install.packages(\"maptools\", repos = \"https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-10-13\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 2.3 Importing Geospatial Datasets\n\n### 2.3.1 Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)\n\nFor shapefile format, two arguments are required: `dsn` to define the data path, and `layer` to provide the shapefile name. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpsz_sf <- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                layer = \"MPSZ-2019\") %>%\n    st_transform(crs = 3414)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\n**Project Transformation**\n\nGiven that our dataset corresponds to the geographical boundaries of Singapore, it is necessary to specify the appropriate CRS for accurate spatial analysis.

To isolate the origin locations, we use the following methodology:\n\n1.  **Grouping by Trajectory ID:**\n\n    -   The dataset is grouped by the unique trajectory identifier (**`trj_id`**).\n\n2.  **Arranging by Timestamp:**\n\n    -   Within each trajectory group, records are arranged in ascending order based on the timestamp (**`pingtimestamp`**).\n\n3.  **Filtering for the First Row:**\n\n    -   By selecting the first row within each grouped trajectory (**`row_number() == 1`**), we identify the earliest recorded location for each trip. This is indicative of the trip's starting point.\n\n4.  **Adding Temporal Information:**\n\n    -   Additional temporal context is provided by introducing new columns:\n\n        -   **`weekday`**: Day of the week based on the timestamp\n\n        -   **`start_hr`**: Starting hour of the trip\n\n        -   **`day`**: Day of the month when the trip started\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrab_origin <- grab_sf %>%\n  group_by(trj_id) %>%\n  arrange(pingtimestamp) %>%\n  filter(row_number()==1) %>% #after sorting by timestamp, first row gives origin location \n  mutate(weekday = wday(pingtimestamp, #define workday\n                        label = TRUE,\n                        abbr = TRUE), #Monday = MON \n        start_hr = factor(hour(pingtimestamp)),\n        day = factor(mday(pingtimestamp))) #to change to ordinal scale\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#write_rds(grab_origin, \"data/rds/grab_origin.rds\")\ngrab_origin <- read_rds(\"data/rds/grab_origin.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n✅ Task Complete! We have retrieved the origin location coordinates for Grab services.\n:::\n\n### 2.5.2 **Extracting Grab Trips Ending Locations**\n\nWe will extract trip ending point for all unique trajectories and store them to a new df named `grab_dest`. We employ a similar methodology to extracting a trips origin location. Except here, within each trajectory group, records are arranged in descending order based on the timestamp (**`pingtimestamp`**). By selecting the first row within each grouped trajectory (**`row_number() == 1`**), we identify the latest recorded location for each trip. This corresponds to the trip's ending point.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrab_dest <- grab_sf %>%\n  group_by(trj_id) %>%\n  arrange(desc(pingtimestamp)) %>% #function from dplyr\n  filter(row_number()==1) %>% #first row after arranging in desc order gives dest  \n  mutate(weekday = wday(pingtimestamp, #define workday\n                        label = TRUE,\n                        abbr = TRUE), #Monday = MON \n        end_hr = factor(hour(pingtimestamp)),\n        day = factor(mday(pingtimestamp))) #to change to ordinal scale\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#write_rds(grab_dest, \"data/rds/grab_dest.rds\")\ngrab_dest <- read_rds(\"data/rds/grab_dest.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n✅ Task Complete! We have retrieved the destination location coordinates for Grab services.\n:::\n\n### 2.5.3 Converting Simple Features to Planar Point Pattern Objects\n\nTo perform spatial point pattern analysis, firstly, we’ll need to convert the simple features objects (grab_orign and grab_dest) into Spatial\\* classes. For this we use `as.ppp` from spatstat package. The `st_coordinates` function extracts the coordiates from our sf objects and `st_bbox` will extract the minimum and maximum coordinates of the object along each axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrab_origin_ppp <- as.ppp(st_coordinates(grab_origin), st_bbox(grab_origin))\n\npar(mar = c(1,1,1,1))\nplot(grab_origin_ppp, main = \"Grab Origin Points as PPP Objects\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrab_dest_ppp <- as.ppp(st_coordinates(grab_dest), st_bbox(grab_dest))\n\npar(mar = c(1,1,1,1))\nplot(grab_dest_ppp, main = \"Grab Destination Points as PPP Objects\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nIt is not neccessary to change `sg_sf` into a ppp object as it will be converted to `owin` instead.\n:::\n\n### 2.5.4 Check for Duplicates and Handle Data Errors\n\nLet's have a look at the `ppp` objects we have created to make sure that there is no duplicates or errors in our data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(grab_origin_ppp)\nsummary(grab_dest_ppp)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n`grab_origin_ppp` and `grab_dest_ppp` objects have no duplicated points, but just to be sure, we check again using the `any(duplicated()` function.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nany(duplicated(grab_origin_ppp)) \nany(duplicated(grab_dest_ppp)) \n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output is false for both objects so we move on to the next step.\n\n### 2.5.5 Introducing OWIN\n\nWhen analysing spatial point patterns, we’ll confine our analysis within a certain geographical area - such as the Singapore boundary. In spatstat, an object called `owin` is specially designed to represent this polygonal region.\n\n### 2.5.5.1 Creating OWIN Object\n\nTo create a two dimensional observation window using `sg_sf` coastal boundary we created earlier, we use the `as.owin` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsg_owin <- as.owin(sg_sf)\nplot(sg_owin)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 2.5.5.2 Combining Point Events and OWIN Object\n\nNow, we’ll extract the relevant point events that are located within Singapore.\n\n### 2.5.5.2.1 Origin Points in OWIN Object\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrab_origin_ppp_sg <- grab_origin_ppp[sg_owin]\npar(mar = c(1,1,1,1))\nplot(grab_origin_ppp_sg, main = '[OWIN] Grab Origin Points' )\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 2.5.5.2.1 Destination Points in OWIN Object\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrab_dest_ppp_sg <- grab_dest_ppp[sg_owin]\npar(mar = c(1,1,1,1))\nplot(grab_dest_ppp_sg, main = '[OWIN] Grab Destination Points' )\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3.0 Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nTo better understand the spatial data, we employ a series of exploratory techniques.\n\n### 3.1 Spatial Relationship between Origin and Destination Points\n\nThe map below shows the geographical distribution of origin and destination points. By overlaying both sets of points, we can observe areas where origin and destination locations overlap. These overlapping areas indicate regions with bidirectional travel.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncombined_map <- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = grab_origin, aes(color = \"Origin\"), alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_sf(data = grab_dest, aes(color = \"Destination\"), alpha = 0.7) +\n  ggtitle(\"Spatial Relationship Between Origin and Destination Locations\") +\n  labs(color = \"Location Type\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Origin\" = \"blue\", \"Destination\" = \"red\"), \n                     name = \"Location Type\", \n                     labels = c(\"Origin\", \"Destination\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nprint(combined_map)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 3.2 Spatio-Temporal Visualisations\n\nSpatio-temporal visualisations show us a view of how data evolves over both space and time. These visualisations are particularly useful for analysing patterns, trends, and relationships within datasets.\n\n### 3.2.1 Frequency of Trip by Hour\n\nLet's create interactive plots to provide an insightful representation of the distribution of origin/destination locations and emphasise the specific hours that stand out in terms of pickup/drop-off frequency.\n\n### 3.2.1.1 Origin or Pickup Frequency\n\nFor creating a bar plot with `ggplot`, the pickup hours are first converted to numeric values for analysis. TThe x-axis represents the pickup hours, and the y-axis represents the count of origin locations. To highlight the hours with the highest count with a visual indication, we add a red dashed vertical line on the plot. The **`ggplot`** object is then converted into an interactive plot using **`ggplotly`**, allowing users to hover over bars for detailed information.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrab_origin$start_hr <- as.numeric(grab_origin$start_hr)\norg<- ggplot(data = grab_origin, aes(x = start_hr)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Origin Locations by Pickup Hour\",\n       x = \"Pickup Hour\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 1)) +\n  theme_minimal()\nmax_hour <- which.max(table(grab_origin$start_hr))\norg <- org + geom_vline(xintercept = max_hour, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\")\n\norg <- ggplotly(org)\norg\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe chart above indicates that most pickups occur at 2-3pm, a potential reason could include:\n\n> **After-School Activities**: this time period may coincide with school release times and after-school activities. Parents might be picking up children or transporting them to various activities.\n\n### 3.2.1.2 Destination or Drop-off Frequency\n\nFor creating a bar plot with `ggplot`, the drop-off hours are first converted to numeric values for analysis. TThe x-axis represents the drop-off hours, and the y-axis represents the count of destination locations. To highlight the hours with the highest count with a visual indication, we add a red dashed vertical line on the plot.

A prominent cluster emerges in the central-south region, encompassing stations such as Newton, Orchard, Downtown East, and Rochor. These areas exhibit increased demand for Grab pickups, potentially influenced by their status as tourist attractions. The tendency for individuals to explore these locales and then opt for Grab as their origin point prompts questions about the efficacy of public transport planning in encouraging more sustainable transportation choices.\n\nAdditionally, a big cluster forms at Changi Airport, which is quite understandable. Travelers landing in Singapore, often fatigued and burdened with luggage, may prefer the convenience of Grab over public transportation for their journey home.\n\nBeyond these, smaller yet discernible clusters show up in various residential zones. Referencing the adaptive bandwidth map for precise locations, we observe clusters in the north (Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang), west (Jurong West, Jurong East), east (Tampines, Pasir Ris), and north-east (Woodlands, Sembawang, Yishun). This prompts further inquiries into the connectivity of these regions to public transport networks and the factors influencing residents to choose Grab over alternative transportation modes.\n\nIn essence, these spatial patterns raise intriguing questions about the accessibility and appeal of public transportation in these specific areas.\n\n### 4.2.7 Extract Planning Areas\n\nFrom the array of residential clusters pinpointed in the previous section, we will focus on four specific stations, each corresponding to distinct geographical regions: north, east, west, and north-east.\n\n-   North: Choa Chu Kang\n\n-   West: Jurong East\n\n-   East: Tampines\n\n-   North-East: Woodlands\n\nLet's extract out these study areas from `mpsz_sf` using `filter` and store it in new objects.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nje = mpsz_sf%>%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N == \"JURONG EAST\")\ntm = mpsz_sf%>%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N == \"TAMPINES\")\nck = mpsz_sf%>%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N == \"CHOA CHU KANG\")\nwd = mpsz_sf%>%\n  filter(PLN_AREA_N == \"WOODLANDS\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 4.2.7.1 Plotting Target Planning Areas\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(st_geometry(je), main = \"Jurong East\")\nplot(st_geometry(tm), main = \"Tampines\")\nplot(st_geometry(ck), main = \"Choa Chu Kang\")\nplot(st_geometry(wd), main = \"Woodlands\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we will create `owin` objects to represent the observation windows for respective planning area.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nje_owin = as.owin(je)\ntm_owin = as.owin(tm)\nck_owin = as.owin(ck)\nwd_owin = as.owin(wd)\n\norigin_je_ppp = grab_origin_ppp_sg[je_owin]\norigin_tm_ppp = grab_origin_ppp_sg[tm_owin]\norigin_ck_ppp = grab_origin_ppp_sg[ck_owin]\norigin_wd_ppp = grab_origin_ppp_sg[wd_owin]\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### **4.2.7.2 KDE Fixed-Bandwidth for Target Planning Areas**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nje_kde_scott <- density(origin_je_ppp, sigma=bw.scott, main=\"Jurong East\")\ntm_kde_scott <- density(origin_tm_ppp, sigma=bw.scott, main=\"Tampines\")\nck_kde_scott <- density(origin_ck_ppp, sigma=bw.scott, main=\"Choa Chu Kang\")\nwd_kde_scott <- density(origin_wd_ppp, sigma=bw.scott, main=\"Woodlands\")\n\n\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\nplot(je_kde_scott,main = \"KDE Jurong East\")\nplot(tm_kde_scott,main = \"KDE Tampines\")\nplot(ck_kde_scott,main = \"KDE Choa Chu Kang\")\nplot(wd_kde_scott,main = \"KDE Woodlands\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, identifying clusters within each planning area is easily achievable. However, pinpointing the exact locations of these clusters requires the incorporation of road networks for each planning area. To achieve this precision, we will leverage a more advanced KDE technique known as Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE) in the upcoming sections. This approach will provide deeper insights into the specific roads or areas within each planning area that host these clusters.\n\n### 4.2.8 Nearest Neighbour Analysis\n\nNearest Neighbor Analysis helps assess whether the observed spatial pattern is clustered, dispersed, or random.\n\nHere we will be using the Clark-Evans Test of Aggregation.\n\n### 4.2.8.1 Clark-Evans Test of Aggregation\n\nHere, we will perform the Clark-Evans test of aggregation for a spatial point pattern by using [*clarkevans.test()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/spatstat/versions/1.63-3/topics/clarkevans.test) of **statspat**.\n\n### 4.2.8.1.1 Origin Points in Jurong East\n\nThe test hypotheses are:\n\n-   H~0~ = The distribution of origin points in Jurong East are randomly distributed\n\n-   H~1~= The distribution of origin points in Jurong East are not randomly distributed\n\nThe 95% confident interval will be used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclarkevans.test(origin_je_ppp,\n                correction=\"none\",\n                clipregion=\"sg_owin\",\n                alternative=c(\"clustered\"),\n                nsim=99)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can conclude that the distribution of origin points in Jurong East is **not randomly distributed**\n\n### 4.2.8.1.2 Origin Points in Tampines\n\nThe test hypotheses are:\n\n-   H~0~ = The distribution of origin points in Tampines are randomly distributed\n\n-   H~1~= The distribution of origin points in Tampines are not randomly distributed\n\nThe 95% confidence interval will be used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclarkevans.test(origin_tm_ppp,\n                correction=\"none\",\n                clipregion=\"sg_owin\",\n                alternative=c(\"clustered\"),\n                nsim=99)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can conclude that the distribution of origin points in Tampines is **not randomly distributed**\n\n### 4.2.8.1.3 Origin Points in Choa Chu Kang\n\nThe test hypotheses are:\n\n-   H~0~ = The distribution of origin points in Choa Chu Kang are randomly distributed\n\n-   H~1~= The distribution of origin points in Choa Chu Kang are not randomly distributed\n\nThe 95% confidence interval will be used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclarkevans.test(origin_ck_ppp,\n                correction=\"none\",\n                clipregion=\"sg_owin\",\n                alternative=c(\"clustered\"),\n                nsim=99)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can conclude that the distribution of origin points in Choa Chu Kang is **not randomly distributed**\n\n### 4.2.8.1.4 Origin Points in Woodlands\n\nThe test hypotheses are:\n\n-   H~0~ = The distribution of origin points in Woodlands are randomly distributed\n\n-   H~1~= The distribution of origin points in Woodlands are not randomly distributed\n\nThe 95% confidence interval will be used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclarkevans.test(origin_wd_ppp,\n                correction=\"none\",\n                clipregion=\"sg_owin\",\n                alternative=c(\"clustered\"),\n                nsim=99)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can conclude that the distribution of origin points in Woodlands is **not randomly distributed**\n\n## **5.0 Network Constrained Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE)**\n\nNetwork Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE) is an advanced technique that builds upon the traditional KDE method.\n\nWe employ NKDE because the distribution of origin points in our planning areas is not randomly distributed; it is significantly influenced by network structures. NKDE allows us to incorporate this network context, providing a more accurate representation of spatial patterns, particularly along roadways. By considering the connectivity and pathways of the network, NKDE enhances our ability to capture the nuanced distribution of clusters within each planning area, leading to more insightful and precise spatial analysis results\n\nThe main difference between the KDE and NKDE is that KDE treats space as a continuous field, and overlooks the underlying network structure, such as roads. NKDE takes into account the network structure, and recognises that spatial relationships may be constrained by the existing road infrastructure. Therefore, NKDE offers better localization of clusters by considering the connectivity and pathways of the network.\n\nHere, we will use `spNetwork` to create NKDE maps for each of our planning areas and explore what insights we can yield from each.\n\n## 5.1 Extract origin points and road network of our study areas\n\nFirstly we need to extract the road networks within each of our study area by using `st_intersection`. We also use `st_union` to combine all the geometries of each object into a single geometry.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nje_roads = st_intersection(sg_roads,st_union(je))\ntm_roads = st_intersection(sg_roads,st_union(tm))\nck_roads = st_intersection(sg_roads,st_union(ck))\nwd_roads = st_intersection(sg_roads,st_union(wd))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter that, we will use `st_intersection` again to find the origin spots that intersect with our planning areas.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nje_origin = st_intersection(grab_origin,st_union(je))\ntm_origin = st_intersection(grab_origin,st_union(tm))\nck_origin = st_intersection(grab_origin,st_union(ck))\nwd_origin = st_intersection(grab_origin,st_union(wd))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 5.2 Lixels\n\nEach network edge is divided into lixels which represent the lines of the network. To get the lixels of each planning area we use the `st_cast` function first to convert the geometry types of the features in our object to LINESTRING.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nje_roads <- st_cast(je_roads, \"LINESTRING\")\ntm_roads <- st_cast(tm_roads, \"LINESTRING\")\nck_roads <- st_cast(ck_roads, \"LINESTRING\")\nwd_roads <- st_cast(wd_roads, \"LINESTRING\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter we have converted the geometry type of our planning areas, we use `lixelize_lines` to create lixels from a set of road lines represented by the planning area objects. The road lines are divided into lixels, each with a length of 750 units. `mindist` represents the minimum distance between lixels to ensure that resulting lixels are not too close to each other. If the length of the resulting lixel is less than the specified minimum distance, it is combined with the previous lixel.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nje_lixels <- lixelize_lines(je_roads, \n                         750, \n                         mindist = 375)\n\ntm_lixels <- lixelize_lines(tm_roads, \n                         750, \n                         mindist = 375)\n\nck_lixels <- lixelize_lines(ck_roads, \n                         750, \n                         mindist = 375)\n\nwd_lixels <- lixelize_lines(wd_roads, \n                         750, \n                         mindist = 375)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 5.3 Line Center\n\nThen we extract the centers of the lixels using `lines_center`. These serve as the locations for intensity estimation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nje_samples <- lines_center(je_lixels)\ntm_samples <- lines_center(tm_lixels)\nck_samples <- lines_center(ck_lixels)\nwd_samples <- lines_center(wd_lixels)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 5.4 Using Simple Method to Compute NKDE\n\nFinally we use the `nkde` function from `spNetwork` to get the NKDE.

Our analyses provided valuable insights, unveiling patterns such as the peak day and time for Grab pick-ups, the specific locations where these pickups occur, hotspots, and the particular roads that witness heightened activity. This information serves as a strategic tool for better planning and decision-making.\n\nFor instance, we can leverage these findings to enhance public transport accessibility. Understanding the road networks with the highest Grab pick-up activity allows us to identify areas where improved public transportation services could be implemented. This strategic planning aims to encourage people to opt for public transport, contributing to even pollution reduction by minimising car usage.\n\nIn our future endeavors, we can expand our exploration by delving into temporal Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE). This advanced analysis will enable us to scrutinise the intricate relationship between time and Grab Hailing Services. By identifying popular pick-up points during specific time intervals, we can propose strategic interventions, such as increasing the number of buses, adjusting bus frequencies, or implementing targeted measures to enhance transportation infrastructure in those areas. This forward-looking approach ensures a nuanced understanding of temporal patterns and facilitates more informed decisions for optimizing transportation services in Singapore.\n\n## 7.0 References\n\n1.
