These points may represent:\n\n-   Occurrences like crime incidents, traffic accidents, or the onset of diseases\n\n-   Business-related points such as coffee shops and fast-food outlets, or essential services like childcare and eldercare facilities.\n\nUsing appropriate functions of spatstat, this hands-on exercise aims to discover the spatial point processes of childcare centres in Singapore.\n\nThe specific questions we aim to address are:\n\n-   Is there a random distribution of childcare centers across Singapore?\n\n-   If not, the subsequent question becomes identifying the areas where there is a higher concentration of childcare centers.\n\n##3.2 Datasets\n\n-   [`CHILDCARE`](https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/2064/datasets/d_61eefab99958fd70e6aab17320a71f1c/view): a point feature data providing both location and attribute information of childcare centres\n\n-   [`MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL`](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/d_5cb80a95445f236737f6bc2bfe5f159d/view): a polygon feature data providing information of URA 2014 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data\n\n-   `CostalOutline`: a polygon feature data showing the national boundary of Singapore\n\n##3.3 R Packages\n\nThe following R packages will be used:\n\n-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), designed to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R.\n\n-   [**spatstat**](https://spatstat.org/), functions for point pattern analysis\n\n-   [**raster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/)  reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e.Â raster)\n\n-   [**maptools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/) provides tools for manipulating geographic data\n\n-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/) provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, spatstat, raster, maptools, tmap)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\npackage 'spatstat.sparse' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'goftest' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'tensor' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'spatstat.data' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'spatstat.geom' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'spatstat.random' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'spatstat.explore' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'spatstat.model' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'spatstat.linnet' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'spatstat.utils' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'spatstat' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\fathi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmpol9rAn\\downloaded_packages\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
